## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Why?
When developing browser automation scripts, there's a lot of overhead in browser start up every time you test a change.

Start a long-running browser server in a separate window and connect to it from your script to iterate faster! The CLI also comes with a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) to help you quickly test code.

## üöÄ Install
```sh
npm i -D playwright-start
```

## üö¶ Quick Setup
Start a browser server:
```sh
npx playwright-start
```

Connect from your code:
```js
const { devices } = require('playwright')
const connect = require('playwright-start')

(async () => {
    const browser = await connect()
    
    const context = await browser.newContext({
        ...Pixel
    })

    const page = await context.newPage()

    // ...
})()
```
